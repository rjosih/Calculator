Helping another friend with c#

## What changes I have done
1) Saved most of the strings in variables. Not liking using "raw strings" in the application.
2) Alla variables are on top of the methods.
3) Have created a method that prints the Console.WritesLines instead of repeating yourself everytime you need to write to the terminal.
4) Have created an array filled with the menu choices to avoid the DRY (don't repeat yourself). Also used the printing method to print the values in the loop.
5) Good to be consistent. Always use "" instead of ''.
6) Also, good to know: WriteLine prints the whole line while Write only prints the string data and can end up on the same line. 
I see many /n which Console.WriteLine provides it "for free" (lol).

Hejdå Jalle hoppas du lärde dig något xoxo
